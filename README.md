# SVG Loader
This small project was done for understand how svg works.
Here were done following steps:
+ Created own svg figure (by adding 11 rectangles)
+ Animated svg with ```@keyframes``` technology
+ Added query for not showing animetion if user doesn't prefer it (```@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)```)
+ Set the appearance for progressbar in different browsers (using vendor prefixes)
